        <h3>Dodge Challenger</h3>
        <h4>28500$</h4>
        <p>The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of automobiles (two of those being pony
          cars)
          produced by American automobile manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge
          was
          in 1959 for marketing a "value version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.</p>
        <p>From model years 1970 to 1974, the first generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler
          E
          platform in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing major components with the Plymouth Barracuda. The
          second generation, from model years 1978 to 1983, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda, a coupe
          version of an economical compact car. The third and current generation is a pony car that was introduced in
          early 2008 originally as a rival to the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth generation
          Chevrolet Camaro.</p>

        <h3>Dodge Charger </h3>
        <h4>35499$</h4>
        <p>The Dodge Charger is a model of automobile marketed by Dodge.</p>
        <p>The first Charger was a show car in 1964. A 1965 Charger II concept car had a remarkable resemblance to the
          1966 production version.</p>
        <p>There have been several different production variants of Chargers, built on three different platforms and
          sizes. In the United States, the Charger nameplate has been used on subcompact hatchbacks, full-size sedans,
          muscle cars, and personal luxury coupes. The current version is a four-door sedan.</p>

        <h3>Dodge Viper </h3>
        <h4>35499$</h4>
        <p>The Dodge Viper is a sports car that was manufactured by Dodge (by SRT for 2013 and 2014), a division of
          American car manufacturer FCA US LLC from 1992 through 2017, having taken a brief hiatus in 2007 and from
          2010
          to 2012. Production of the two-seat super car began at New Mack Assembly Plant in 1991 and moved to Conner
          Avenue Assembly Plant in October 1995.</p>
        <p>Although Chrysler considered ending production because of serious financial problems, on September 14,
          2010,
          the then chief executive Sergio Marchionne announced and previewed a new model of the Viper for 2012. In
          2014,
          the Viper was named number 10 on the "Most American Cars" list, meaning 75% or more of its parts are
          manufactured in the U.S.</p>
        <p>The Viper was eventually discontinued in 2017 after being in production for just over twenty years.</p>

        <h3>Chevrolet Camaro </h3>
        <h4>38999$</h4>
        <p>The Chevrolet Camaro is a mid-size American automobile manufactured by Chevrolet, classified as a pony car
          and also as a muscle car with some versions. It first went on sale on September 29, 1966, for the 1967 model
          year and was designed as a competing model to the Ford Mustang. The Camaro shared its platform and major
          components with the Pontiac Firebird, also introduced for 1967.</p>
        <p>Four distinct generations of the Camaro were developed before production ended in 2002. The nameplate was
          revived on a concept car that evolved into the fifth-generation Camaro; production started on March 16,
          2009.
          Over 5 million Camaros have been sold.</p>

        <h3>Chevrolet Corvette </h3>
        <h4>70000$</h4>
        <p>The Chevrolet Corvette, colloquially known as the 'Vette, is a two-door, two-passenger sports car
          manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet across more than 60 years of production and eight design generations.
          From 1953 to 2019, it was front-engined, and since 2020, it is mid-engined. With its generations noted
          sequentially from C1 to C8, the Corvette serves as Chevrolet's halo vehicle and is widely noted for its
          performance and distinctive plastic—either fiberglass or composite—bodywork.</p>
        <p>In 1953, when GM executives were looking to name the new Chevrolet sports car, assistant director for the
          Public Relations department Myron Scott suggested Corvette after the small maneuverable warship—and the name
          was approved. The first model, a convertible, was introduced at the GM Motorama in 1953 as a concept and was
          followed ten years later by the 1963 second generation, in coupe and convertible styles. Originally
          manufactured in Flint, Michigan and St. Louis, Missouri, the Corvette has been manufactured in Bowling
          Green,
          Kentucky since 1981.The Corvette has since become widely known as "America's Sports Car." Automotive News
          wrote that after 'starring' in the early 1960s television show Route 66, the Corvette became synonymous with
          freedom and adventure," ultimately becoming both "the most successful concept car in history and the most
          popular sports car in history."</p>

        <h3>Saleen S1 </h3>
        <h4>100000$</h4>
        <p>The Saleen S1, also called the Saleen 1, is a two-seater sports car developed and built by American
          automobile manufacturer Saleen Automotive. It was unveiled at the 2017 LA Auto Show, and is the first car
          developed entirely by Saleen since the Saleen S7 ended production in 2009. Production of the S1 is planned
          to
          be 1,500 units yearly, with a starting price of US$100,000 each.</p>

        <h3>Saleen S7 </h3>
        <h4>450000$</h4>
        <p>The Saleen S7 is an American hand-built, high-performance sports car designed and built by American
          automobile manufacturer Saleen Automotive Inc. Developed jointly by Steve Saleen for the initial concept,
          direction and engine, Hidden Creek Industries for resources and initial funding, Ray Mallock Ltd. (RML) for
          chassis, suspension and aerodynamics, and Phil Frank for the body and interior CAD design and development.
        </p>
        <p>It was the first fully proprietary car produced by Saleen and became America's fifth mid-engine production
          sports car coming after the Consulier GTP, Mosler Raptor, Vector W8, and M12. The S7 debuted on August 19,
          2000 at the Monterey Historic Races. The all-aluminium engine is a proprietary unit developed and built in
          house, it is a bored-and-stroked derivative of Ford's 351 Windsor small block architecture with
          Cleveland-style canted valve heads which have been extensively reworked and modified. Having a large
          displacement of 427 cubic inches (7.0 L) the engine is based on and has been developed around the more
          compact
          and lighter small-block architecture and is in fact not based on the FE big-block. It proved remarkably
          tractable and flexible for a high-output requirement—550 hp (410 kW) at 6,400 rpm. In 2005, the S7 gained a
          more powerful twin-turbocharged powerplant which boosted engine power to 750 hp (559 kW) and estimated top
          speed of 248 mph (399 km/h).</p>

        <p>The Equus Bass 770 is a handcrafted American luxury muscle and super car manufactured by the company Equus
          Automotive.</p>
        <p>It is named after Equus Automotive's founder Bassam Abdallah.</p>
        <p>At its launch, six models could be chosen: Accent, Accent Plus, Design, Design Plus, Edition and
          Collection.
          Currently, its price starts at US$534,000, making the Bass 770 one of the most expensive muscle cars.</p>

        <h3>Equus Throwback</h3>
        <h4>130000$</h4>
        <p>Equus, the same U.S.-based firm behind the fantastically cool Bass 770 muscle car, is back again with
          another
          stylish creation, the Throwback. It's a supercar based on the C7-generation Corvette packing up to 1000
          horsepower, 822 lb.-ft. of torque, a claimed 0-60 time of 2.5 seconds, and a top speed of over 220 MPH.</p>
        <p>While the proportions are definitely C7-esque, Equus claims the Throwback is more than just a kitted-up
          'Vette. The exterior has been transformed with the company's unique styling, featuring two center-mounted
          fog
          lights up front, and taillights reminiscent of a late-model C3 Corvette. It's also worth pointing out the
          absolutely massive triple-exit exhaust pipes, but chances are you've already noticed them.</p>
        <p>The interior keeps the same basic layout as the C7, but is upgraded with Equus's own materials and styling.
          The company hasn't revealed what sort of drivetrain upgrades the Throwback will use, only that it will start
          at $130,000 for the base model.</p>
        <p>Equus will only produce 25 examples of the Throwback, and notes customization and personalization options
          for
          customers are virtually endless. If you want something unique to show up with at your next Corvette meet, we
          can't think of anything better.</p>
